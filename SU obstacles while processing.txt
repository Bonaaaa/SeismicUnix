if you found:
"surange: fgettr.c: no data on first trace"
or
"surange: fgettr.c: bad first header"
it may caused by Endianness of the dataset. Most of dataset already compatible to little endian, but if you working on old sample segy from a very old computer, probably you need to convert it to xdr format. Do it with:
"try suoldtonew < file.su > file.new.su"
if it not help, try 
"suswapbytes < file.su > file.fix.su"
for further information about the function you can type the function (suxxxxx) into the terminal.
